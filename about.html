				<p class="my_statement"><strong>My</strong> interest in media developed when I watched TV series broadcast on TVB
                    Jade Channel at a young age. At that time, I not only learned Cantonese through
                    television but gradually realized that media played a critical role in our daily life and
                    influenced our opinion on social phenomena. Besides, influenced by my uncle and
                    father, who were fond of watching Star Wars and collecting Garage Kits, I started to
                    get exposure to audio-visual language and was curious about film production. Therefore, I want to learn more about media knowledge and its application in
                    authentic cases professionally. In this case, I decided to apply for the Communication at The HKBU.<br>
                    <strong>As</strong> a diligent undergraduate student at Sichuan University of Media and Communications, I had made sufficient preparations to pursue postgraduate studies in
                    New Media. Concretely, the course Five Steps to New Media Marketing made me
                    familiar with new media platforms and content marketing, which was beneficial to
                    cultivate my competence in marketing and content production. In addition, Fundamentals of Director fostered my taste for humanity and art and helped me
                    master the basic principles of creation and audio-visual expression. Benefiting from
                    this course, I was adept at using software like Adobe Audition, Adobe Premiere Pro, and DaVinci Resolve. Through learning European and American Film Culture, I
                    could comprehend the concept of film language and narrative and mastered the skills
                    of effectively presenting the natural world and stories via appropriate films. Thus, the
                    academic study equipped me with enough ability to produce reasonable texts and
                    understand the conventions of different genres, paving the way for analyzing media
                    texts from a unique and refreshing insight.<br>
                    <strong> Driven</strong> this passion and appreciation for new media, I actively sought
                    opportunities to increase my training in the industry and hone my skills. Concretely, I
                    operated Xiaohongshu Account called Toongkk, which concentrated on current events
                    and hot culture to attract more audiences. As for my responsibilities, I took charge of
                    content planning with suitable soft advertisements to achieve satisfactory promotion. I
                    strictly controlled the shooting materials to attract more fans, which needed to keep in
                    touch with reality to increase the account’s influence. More importantly, this
                    meaningful practice boosted my sharp mind towards hot spots and enhanced my data
                    analysis capability by analyzing background data to adjust operation projects. Additionally, I wrote, directed, edited, and produced the maiden work, a microfilm
                    named Flying to the Moon. In terms of production, I encountered a tricky issue of
                    funding shortage. To settle this problem, I communicated with the equipment staff and
                    suggested they sponsor us. In return, our members could popularize the use of this
                    facility. Moreover, I was in charge of content production to reflect different facets of
                    human lives, immensely strengthening my writing ability. From my perspective, filmmaking was just like a media platform, which adopted various media devices to
                    demonstrate people’s life and thoughts through sounds and images. Furthermore, I
                    acted as an intern at the 10th China Internet Audio & Video Convention, where I was
                    involved in site activity execution. I was responsible for ensuring the smooth running
                    of the activity and inviting the honored guests and popular media to accept an
                    interview. When confronting the lack of audience, I was requested to discover 20
                    spectators to enhance their interaction with distinguished guests. To solve this thorny
                    matter, I tried communicating with nearby university teachers to organize 20 college
                    students to participate in this activity. It was worth mentioning that this event
                    profoundly cultivated my organizing and communication capabilities. Remarkably, I
                    was fortunate to attend the significant forum, which fostered my new perception
                    towards the development of the future media industry, laying a solid foundation for
                    further study in this field.<br>
                    <strong>At this point,</strong> I know I need additional education to accomplish my objective, and the MSc in New Media program at The Chinese University of Hong Kong
                    perfectly aligns with my interests and is a solid link between my current academic
                    passions and future learning aspirations due to its curriculum and faculty. While in the
                    program, I plan to take multiple modules, such as New Media Content Development, New Media Content Development, Understanding Culture Thro Film, and New
                    Communication Technologies: Trends and Impacts, to provide me with a broad
                    understanding of interpersonal communication, organizational communication, computer-mediated communication, and intercultural communication theories. Notably, I will have a precious opportunity to receive hands-on training in multimedia
                    design, development, user interface design, and data analytics to accelerate my
                    practical competence and accumulate more industry experience. Based on the
                    knowledge acquired from classroom and extracurricular practice, I can conduct
                    content and audience research and apply this knowledge in designing strategic
                    information campaigns using new media devices. Above all, this advanced program is
                    conducive to further enhancing my academic study and comprehensive abilities and
                    gaining a deeper understanding of new media and its value. It can help me in my
                    future endeavors. <br>
                    <strong>After</strong> completing my master’s degree and obtaining the necessary knowledge in
                    new media, I plan to seek employment for a few years with a firm that will enable me
                    to acquire the required hands-on practice. More specifically, I will engage in content
                    output or operation of the related content during my tenure to broaden my horizon. Based on the accumulated knowledge and industry experience, I will establish an
                    MCN media company where I devote myself to promoting qualified content with
                    massive Internet hits. Beyond that, I will create the image of virtual idols and online
                    celebrities to launch peripheral products.</p>
